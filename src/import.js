/* open file, return useful information from CSV. 
designed soley for AWHN's .csv files. May not work for others. */

Right now, the only information we need is the name and the regular pay amount or the salary amount.

Maybe we can take the csv, display as a table, and ask user to pick which cells apply to which information?

Ok, so lets start by taking a super annoying csv and turning it into a table.
